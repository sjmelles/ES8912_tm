The aim of sharing this code and demo is so that others can repeat and extend our study or analyze their own data. I have tried to adequately document the code.

To download the code from the GitHub site just click the 'Clone or Download' button (near the top on the right) and select 'Download ZIP'. Make a note of the 'Latest commit' number in case you have any questions for me. If you use GitHub then feel free to fork and adapt the code.

If you want to apply the code to your own PDFs then just use the latest version that will be automatically displayed on the GitHub site.

This demo uses a set of 22 demo pdf files. The submitted manuscript analysed over 9000 pdfs.  

If you have problems with the code, please contact me.

Thanks,

Stephanie Melles.
