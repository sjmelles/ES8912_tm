# Text mining PDFs

This repository contains R code for the paper:

**Diversity of practitioners publishing in five leading international journals of applied ecology and conservation biology, 1987 â€“ 2015 relative to global biodiversity hotspots**

*by Stephanie Melles, Christopher Scarpone, Adisa Julien, Julie Robertson, Jennifer Bello Levieva, Courtney Carrier, Robert France, Sabrina Gvuenc, Wai Ying Lam, Michelle Lucas, Alexus Maglalang, Keira McKee, Frances Okoye, and Kayla Wong*

submitted to ***Ecoscience*** (TECO-2019-0019). The paper will be available at: url: <>

The aim of sharing this code and demo is so that others can repeat and extend our study or analyze their own data. I have tried to adequately document the code.

To download from the GitHub site just click the 'Clone or Download' button (near the top on the right) and select 'Download ZIP'. Make a note of the 'Latest commit' number in case you have any questions for me. If you use GitHub then feel free to fork and adapt the code.

The original code was shared and prepared for a graduate class in Applied Ecology at Ryerson University. This original code is stored under the **'App_Eco_Text_mining'** folder, which was created in fall 2017. If you want to apply the method described in our paper to your own PDFs, use the project and code stored in the folder **'Ecosci_text_mining_DEMO_V0.1'**. This folder contains a demonstration that shows how the pdfs were mined. Note that the R code relies on **'pdftotext.exe'** version 4.01 to be installed and working on your machine. See: <https://www.xpdfreader.com/pdftotext-man.html> for details.

This demo uses a set of 22 demo pdf files. The submitted manuscript analysed over 9000 pdfs.  

If you have problems with the code, please contact me.

Thanks,

Stephanie Melles.
